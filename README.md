# ArraySumThreads

An array of random numbers is created

The array is divided into a given number of parts (a multiple of the number of array elements)

The sum of elements of each part is counted in a separate thread (each thread counts the sum of elements of one part of the array)

The sum of elements of each part of the array and the total sum of elements of the whole array are displayed

The algorithm's execution time is displayed in milliseconds
